Little Miss Sunshine is a film dear to my heart. It is one of those films that I think would have been beneficial for me to see earlier in ife, because it tackles topics such as suicide, eating disorders, and self love in a very soft and kind way. It is a feel good film about a dysfunctional family coming together to help their youngest relative, and best of all, it has Eugene Lang alum, and one of my personal favorite actors, Paul Dano.
