Suspiria 1977 is probably one of my favorite horror movies of all time. The intensly saturated colors add to the dreamlike atmosphere, making the whole film feel like the protagonist, Suzy, is trapped in a fever dream. It also plays on my own personal fear of being trapped somewhere new, the fear of the unknown is strong in this movie, however, knowing almost makes it worse.
