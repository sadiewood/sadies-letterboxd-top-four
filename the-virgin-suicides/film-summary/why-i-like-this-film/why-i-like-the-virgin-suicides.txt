The Virgin Suicides is the most recent addition to my letterboxd top four, as I only recently had the chance to watch it. This film is one of the best I have seen in a while, Sofia Coppola does an amazing job capturing the hazy glow of girlhood, as well as the bond between the sisters. The visuals in this film are truley hauntingly breath-taking, and deeply human. This film will make you cry, but most of all, it will make you reflect on your own place in the world, and your femininity. This film is Barbie for girls who are obsessed with Lana Del Rey and Catholich iconography.
