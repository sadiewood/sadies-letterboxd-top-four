I love Fight Club becuase I am a sucker for a man movie. David Fincher is one of my favorite directors of all time, and I think the fact that he made a film deemed so offensive that people walked out 1999 Venice film festival premier, but ended up  becoming part of the film lover canon is really cool. Fight Club's slimey green tinge and gratuitous violence is not for everyone, but for those who love a Fincher mind-fuck movie, this is one of his best.
